Project Planning
1.  Create a Git repository and put all code and plans into it, to include:
	Diagrams
	Flowcharts
	Other documentation
2.  Wear my shirt and shorts:
	It's cold, so I'll wear it over my regular clothes.
3.  Iterate in development.  To do this, I need a list of stages to go through:
	a.  Manually turn each light on and off
	b.  Lights cycle (green to yellow to red) automatically (without pause)
	c.  Add a timer to have the light turn red automatically at intervals
			(i.e., so that it is green for, say, 2 minutes, then
			turns yellow and then red, stays red for 2 minutes, and
			then turns green again, etc).  
	d.  Add "Vehicle Present" button to simulate a car waiting at the 
			crossing intersection (at this stage, the "Vehicle
			Present" and automatic timing should interact together
			seamlessly).
	e.  Add the ability to change the length of time the light remains 
			green and red on the timer.
	f.  Add the ability to set a speed limit setting which then sets the
			length of the yellow light automatically.  (Is there a
			standard for this?)
	g.  Integrate the "Vehicle Present" function with the ultrasonic
			distance sensor so that it can be activated either way
			(to allow a user to test the functionality without
			actually having to drive up to the stoplight in a
			vehicle).  
I also need to save each code version at each stage so that each one can be
examined independently (to demonstrate the iterations).  
4.  Create supporting documentation:
	Design documents
	Images
	Illustrations
	Code (including clear and understandable comments)
	Documentation for (included in the repository):
		End users
		OPS
		Engineering teams
